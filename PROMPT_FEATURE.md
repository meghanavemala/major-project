# User Prompt Feature for AI Video Summarizer

## Overview

The AI Video Summarizer now includes a powerful **Custom Analysis Prompt** feature that allows users to guide the AI's topic clustering and summarization based on their specific interests and requirements.

## How It Works

### 1. **Custom Analysis Prompt Input**
Users can provide a text prompt describing what aspects of the video content they want to focus on. This prompt guides the AI in:
- **Topic Clustering**: Organizing content into topics that align with user interests
- **Topic Naming**: Creating more relevant and focused topic names
- **Summarization**: Generating summaries that emphasize the user's areas of interest

### 2. **Enhanced Topic Analysis**
The user prompt is integrated into the topic analysis pipeline:
- **Context Enhancement**: The prompt is added as context to each text segment
- **Keyword Matching**: Topic names are enhanced with prompt-relevant terms
- **Clustering Guidance**: The AI uses the prompt to better understand content relationships

### 3. **Focused Summarization**
Summaries are tailored to the user's interests:
- **Prompt Integration**: The user prompt is included as focus guidance
- **Relevant Content**: Summaries emphasize aspects mentioned in the prompt
- **Context-Aware**: Better understanding of what information is most valuable to the user

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Technical Focus
**Prompt**: "Focus on technical concepts, implementation steps, and code examples"

**Result**: 
- Topics will be organized around technical aspects
- Topic names like "Machine Learning (Technical)" or "Implementation Steps"
- Summaries emphasize technical details and practical implementation

### Example 2: Business Applications
**Prompt**: "Highlight practical applications, real-world examples, and business use cases"

**Result**:
- Topics focus on business value and applications
- Topic names like "Fraud Detection (Applications)" or "Business Use Cases"
- Summaries emphasize real-world impact and business benefits

### Example 3: Key Insights
**Prompt**: "Emphasize key insights, conclusions, and main takeaways"

**Result**:
- Topics organized around insights and conclusions
- Topic names like "Key Insights" or "Main Conclusions"
- Summaries focus on the most important learnings and takeaways

### Example 4: Tutorial Focus
**Prompt**: "Cover step-by-step tutorials, practical examples, and hands-on guidance"

**Result**:
- Topics structured as tutorial segments
- Topic names like "Setup Tutorial" or "Hands-on Examples"
- Summaries provide clear step-by-step guidance

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes
- Added a new textarea field for the custom prompt
- Included helpful placeholder text with examples
- Added styling for the new form element

### Backend Changes
- Modified `analyze_topic_segments()` to accept and use user prompts
- Enhanced `generate_topic_name()` with prompt-aware naming
- Updated `summarize_cluster()` to incorporate prompt guidance
- Added prompt parameter to the main processing pipeline

### Technical Features
- **Context Enhancement**: User prompt is added to text segments for better analysis
- **Keyword Matching**: Prompt keywords are matched with topic keywords for better naming
- **Focus Guidance**: Summaries are generated with the user's interests in mind
- **Fallback Support**: Works seamlessly even without a user prompt

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Personalized Analysis**: Content analysis tailored to specific interests
- **Better Organization**: Topics organized around user-relevant themes
- **Focused Summaries**: Summaries that emphasize what matters most to the user
- **Flexible Use Cases**: Support for different types of content analysis needs

### For Content Creators
- **Audience Targeting**: Create summaries for different audience types
- **Content Focus**: Emphasize specific aspects of educational content
- **Use Case Adaptation**: Adapt summaries for different use cases (tutorials, insights, applications)

### For Researchers
- **Specific Analysis**: Focus on particular research aspects
- **Custom Clustering**: Organize content based on research interests
- **Targeted Summaries**: Generate summaries relevant to specific research questions

## Testing

Run the test script to see the feature in action:

```bash
python test_prompt_feature.py
```

This will demonstrate:
- Default analysis without prompts
- Technical focus analysis
- Practical applications focus
- Summarization with different prompts

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the prompt feature:
- **Prompt Templates**: Pre-defined prompt templates for common use cases
- **Multi-Prompt Support**: Support for multiple prompts in a single analysis
- **Prompt Learning**: AI learns from user feedback to improve prompt effectiveness
- **Visual Prompt Builder**: GUI for building complex prompts
- **Prompt History**: Save and reuse effective prompts

## Conclusion

The Custom Analysis Prompt feature significantly enhances the AI Video Summarizer's ability to provide personalized, relevant content analysis. By allowing users to specify their interests and requirements, the system can generate more useful and targeted summaries that better serve their specific needs.
